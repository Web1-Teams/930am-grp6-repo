# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

              Welcome to (Nafs) web site, a platform dedicated to exploring the human psyche, its disorders, and the influence of words and thoughts on the mind. It delves into topics that may not often cross people's minds but have significant impacts on life, success, and achievement. Join us on a journey as we navigate the depths of the human soul.
(Nafs) platform focuses on four main areas:
1.	Mental Disorders: Exploring various psychological conditions.
2.	Psychological Disturbances: Addressing disruptions to mental well-being.
3.	Intellectual Patterns: Discussing thought processes and their connection to the psyche.
4.	Podcast Recommendations: Featuring curated podcasts that tackle diverse topics related to human psychology.
               The sections on mental disorders and psychological disturbances are grounded in reliable scientific and medical information. The intellectual patterns section delves into the relationship between the mind, thinking, and the human psyche, drawing from notable books such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. Lastly, the podcast recommendations page highlights expert content on human relationships, psychiatry, and even the intersection of psychology and Religious matters.

                Talking about the technical side, Nafs Platform is built on react, this code represents a React-based application utilizing react-router-dom for navigation between different components and pages. It employs modern React features such as functional components, hooks like useParams, and the newer Routes and element props for defining routes. The application organizes content dynamically, with data passed as props to components like Pattern, Podcast, and Disease, ensuring reusability and maintainability. The navigation system leverages an array of objects (navigationItems) to centralize and manage routes and menu items, promoting scalability. Additionally, the use of JSX allows for a clean structure, combining layout and logic in a declarative format, while modularized imports ensure separation of concerns and easier debugging.
